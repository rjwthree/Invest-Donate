## Investment is good for charitable donations

This is a minor project in which I show that there are great, non-selfish benefits to investing money you intend to give to charity. I consider a strategy in which you donate a small fraction of the assets intended for charity each year, while investing the rest. Click [here](https://github.com/rjwthree/Invest-donate/blob/main/InvestDonate.pdf) to read about it and [here](https://github.com/rjwthree/Invest-donate/blob/main/InvestDonate.py) to see the Python functions I wrote that make it easy to calculate the results of any variant of the strategy.

In this scenario we imagine an initial amount of disposable money, say $1,000, that we want to donate. Instead of doing so all at once, we can invest it and donate 1% at the end of each year. This plot shows how many years it would take to donate multiples of the original amount for various growth rates.

A realistic growth rate for the stock market, 10%, would allow someone to donate more than 20 times the original amount over 60 years. They would also have grown the original $1,000 investment to more than $166,000, which could be used for continued 1% donations, or donated as well for a total donation of more than $186,000. This is an impressive lifetime outcome for a mere $1,000.

We can also note the power of compounding growth: although it took 60 years to reach 20 times the original donation, it would take only another 8 years to do that again, and another 5 years to do it a third time.

How would this approach fare with a higher donation rate like 2%?
