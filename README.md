## Investment is good for charitable donations

This is a minor project in which I showed that there are great, non-selfish benefits to investing money you intend to give to charity. I consider a strategy in which you donate a small fraction of the assets intended for charity each year, while investing the rest. Click [here](https://github.com/rjwthree/Invest-donate/blob/main/InvestDonate.pdf) to read about it and [here](https://github.com/rjwthree/Invest-donate/blob/main/InvestDonate.py) to see the Python functions I wrote that makes it easy to calculate any variant of the strategy.
